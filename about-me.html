    <p> hello! my name is wen yu chen (陈文宇) and i'm a third year undergraduate student studying information science in the college of agriculture and life sciences at cornell university.</p>

    <p>i am primarily interested in creating a multidisciplinary practice in my personal and professional life with design principles, technology, and sustainablity in mind.</p>

    <h2>more about me!</h2>

    <p>i am from brooklyn, new york city and grew up with my parents and sister.</p>

    <p>my family found it important to instill important cultural values from their home country, china, so i have an interest in honing my knowledge of cantonese and mandarin. i'm fluent in cantonese, but i'm always looking to improve!</p>

    <p>my ethnic and cultural identity influence how i approach my work in information science because many online spaces relaying important information in the U.S. are not accessible for those who aren't fluent in english. my personal experiences with my parents and grandparents who are unfamiliar with new forms of technology is only a small blip in the multitude of people who have these similar experiences. thus, i am really motivated in questioning how much design is truly universal and intuitive, in addition to challenging the assumed cultural norms in the our technological spaces.</p>

    <p>design is not only a part of my professional and academic life however. i love creating art and photography and design is instrinsically a part of these spaces as well! on the side, i have a practice involving paper-making, sculpture, ceramics, painting, and digital art. i also recently dove into the world of old digital cameras and adopted a kodak easyshare c633 that i have been experimenting with!</p>
